# Path Resolution Solution

## Summary of Changes

1. **Created a robust path-fixing system:**
   - Dynamic detection of main pages vs subpages
   - Automatic path correction for CSS, JS, images, and components
   - Works seamlessly in both development and production environments

2. **Updated component loading to be path-aware:**
   - Components now load from the correct relative path based on page location
   - Header and footer work properly on all pages
   - Navigation links correctly point to the right locations

3. **Created standardized templates and documentation:**
   - Subpage template with correct relative paths
   - README with clear guidelines for developers
   - Documentation on path resolution strategy

4. **All paths are now relative, making the site portable:**
   - No more absolute paths that break between environments
   - Site can be deployed to any server location without breaking
   - Fallback mechanisms ensure compatibility with older pages

## Key Files Modified

- **js/fix-subpage-paths.js** - Intelligent path fixing script
- **js/components.js** - Updated to use relative paths based on page location
- **templates/subpage-template.html** - Template for new subpages
- **README.md** - Updated with guidelines for developers

## Implementation Details

The solution uses a two-pronged approach:

1. **Static Path Updating:**
   - `update-all-subpages.js` script to batch update all existing pages

2. **Dynamic Path Fixing:**
   - Client-side script that detects page location and fixes paths on the fly
   - Page type detection (`isSubpage()` function) to determine correct path prefix
   - Automatic adjustment of all resource paths based on page location

## Path Resolution Strategy

- **Main Pages**: Use `./` relative paths (e.g., `./css/styles.css`)
- **Subpages**: Use `../` relative paths (e.g., `../css/styles.css`)

This ensures that all resources load correctly regardless of where the page is located in the site structure.

## Impact

- **Fixed 404 errors** for components, CSS, and JavaScript files
- **Eliminated environment-specific code** for better maintainability
- **Simplified path resolution** to a consistent pattern
- **Provided clear documentation** for future development
